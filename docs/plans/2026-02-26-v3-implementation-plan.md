# V3 Swarm Architecture Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Transform Genesis-01 from a "solo founder" agent into a meta-meta-orchestrator managing recursive swarm hierarchies, with persistent state directories simulating permanent agents.

**Architecture:** Ephemeral sub-agents with persistent state directories. Each "permanent agent" is a state dir spawned fresh each heartbeat. Slot budget protocol prevents queue buildup. Model tiering (Sonnet depth 0-1, Haiku depth 2+) controls costs.

**Tech Stack:** OpenClaw agent framework, Docker, Python scripts, Telegram

**Design Doc:** `docs/plans/2026-02-26-v3-swarm-architecture-design.md`

---

### Task 1: Archive V2 Files

**Files:**
- Create: `archive/v2/` directory
- Move: `STRATEGY.md`, `STRATEGY_ARCHIVE.md`, `STATE.json`, `protocols/`, `HEARTBEAT.md`
- Move: `thinking/product-market-fit.md`, `thinking/business-architecture.md`, `thinking/meta-review.md`
- Keep in place: `roles/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `SOUL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `IDENTITY.md`
- Keep in place: `BOT_REQUESTS.md`, `HUMAN_RESPONSES.md`, `OPENCLAW_GOAL.md`

**Step 1: Create archive directory and move V2 files**

```bash
cd /workspace
mkdir -p archive/v2/protocols archive/v2/thinking
mv STRATEGY.md archive/v2/ 2>/dev/null
mv STRATEGY_ARCHIVE.md archive/v2/ 2>/dev/null
mv STATE.json archive/v2/ 2>/dev/null
mv protocols/ceo-mode.md archive/v2/protocols/ 2>/dev/null
mv protocols/delegation-briefs.md archive/v2/protocols/ 2>/dev/null
mv protocols/twitter-daily.md archive/v2/protocols/ 2>/dev/null
mv thinking/product-market-fit.md archive/v2/thinking/ 2>/dev/null
mv thinking/business-architecture.md archive/v2/thinking/ 2>/dev/null
mv thinking/meta-review.md archive/v2/thinking/ 2>/dev/null
rmdir protocols 2>/dev/null
rmdir thinking 2>/dev/null
```

**Step 2: Verify**

```bash
ls archive/v2/
# Expected: STRATEGY.md, STRATEGY_ARCHIVE.md, STATE.json, protocols/, thinking/
ls roles/
# Expected: _shared-rules.md, copywriter.md, qa-reviewer.md, researcher.md, product-builder.md, etc.
ls scripts/
# Expected: browse.py, twitter.py, tweet_browser.py, post_bluesky.py, etc.
```

**Step 3: Remove roles that are replaced by swarm structure**

```bash
mv roles/marketing-director.md archive/v2/ 2>/dev/null
mv roles/claude-code-builder.md archive/v2/ 2>/dev/null
```

---

### Task 2: Create Swarm Directory Structure

**Files:**
- Create: `swarm/`, `swarm/meta/`, `swarm/ideas/`, `swarm/templates/`, `swarm/agents/`
- Create: `swarm/meta/improvement/`, `swarm/meta/improvement/log/`
- Create: `swarm/meta/scout/`, `swarm/meta/scout/opportunities/`
- Create: `swarm/meta/capability-tester/`
- Create: `thinking/` (fresh, for V3)

**Step 1: Create all directories**

```bash
cd /workspace
mkdir -p swarm/meta/improvement/log
mkdir -p swarm/meta/scout/opportunities
mkdir -p swarm/meta/capability-tester
mkdir -p swarm/ideas
mkdir -p swarm/templates
mkdir -p swarm/agents
mkdir -p thinking
```

**Step 2: Verify structure**

```bash
find swarm -type d | sort
# Expected:
# swarm
# swarm/agents
# swarm/ideas
# swarm/meta
# swarm/meta/capability-tester
# swarm/meta/improvement
# swarm/meta/improvement/log
# swarm/meta/scout
# swarm/meta/scout/opportunities
# swarm/templates
```

---

### Task 3: Write Swarm State (Initial)

**Files:**
- Create: `swarm/state.json`

**Step 1: Write initial swarm state**

```json
{
  "heartbeat": 0,
  "phase": "exploration",
  "phase_started": "2026-02-27",
  "slots": {
    "max": 12,
    "in_use": 0,
    "reserved": 0,
    "available": 12
  },
  "metas": {},
  "global_agents": {
    "improvement": {
      "last_run": null,
      "next_due": "HB-3",
      "total_improvements": 0
    },
    "scout": {
      "last_run": null,
      "next_due": "HB-1",
      "pending_opportunities": 0
    },
    "capability_tester": {
      "last_run": null,
      "next_due": "HB-1",
      "capabilities_tested": 0
    }
  },
  "recent_completions": [],
  "recent_failures": [],
  "notes": "V3 initialized. Phase 1: Exploration. No ideas/products yet."
}
```

**Step 2: Validate JSON**

```bash
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('swarm/state.json')); print('valid')"
```

---

### Task 4: Write Global Meta Agent Files

**Files:**
- Create: `swarm/meta/improvement/role.md`
- Create: `swarm/meta/improvement/state.json`
- Create: `swarm/meta/scout/role.md`
- Create: `swarm/meta/scout/state.json`
- Create: `swarm/meta/capability-tester/role.md`
- Create: `swarm/meta/capability-tester/state.json`
- Create: `swarm/meta/capability-tester/capabilities.json`

**Step 1: Write Improvement Agent role**

File: `swarm/meta/improvement/role.md`

```markdown
# Improvement Agent

You review the Genesis swarm's performance and fix what's broken.

## Your Job

1. Read swarm/state.json for current swarm status
2. Read swarm/agents/*/results.json for recent agent outputs
3. Read swarm/meta/*/state.json for each meta agent's status
4. Identify: what failed? what's slow? what process is missing?
5. Implement fixes: update role files, suggest CLAUDE.md changes, create new templates

## What You Can Modify

- swarm/meta/*/role.md (improve agent instructions)
- swarm/templates/*.md (improve templates)
- roles/*.md (improve worker role definitions)
- Your own state.json (record findings)

## What You Cannot Modify

- CLAUDE.md (suggest changes in results, don't edit directly)
- swarm/state.json (only Genesis updates this)
- scripts/* (suggest changes, don't edit)

## Your Cycle

1. Read your state.json for last focus area and findings
2. Check recent failures in swarm/state.json
3. Read 2-3 agent result files to understand what went wrong
4. Identify root cause and write a fix
5. Update your state.json with findings and changes made
6. Write results to swarm/agents/[your-label]/results.json

## Output Format (results.json)

```json
{
  "agent": "improvement",
  "findings": ["description of what was broken"],
  "changes_made": ["what files were modified and how"],
  "suggestions_for_genesis": ["things only Genesis can change"],
  "health_assessment": "green|yellow|red"
}
```

## Key Principle

Be specific. "Marketing output is low quality" is useless.
"Copywriter role.md doesn't mention Bluesky's 300-char limit, causing truncated posts"
is actionable. Find the root cause and fix it.
```

**Step 2: Write Improvement Agent initial state**

File: `swarm/meta/improvement/state.json`

```json
{
  "last_run_hb": null,
  "total_improvements": 0,
  "focus_areas": [],
  "recent_findings": [],
  "changes_log": []
}
```

**Step 3: Write Scout Agent role**

File: `swarm/meta/scout/role.md`

```markdown
# Scout Agent

You find new revenue opportunities and score them for Genesis.

## Your Job

1. Read your state.json for what you've already explored
2. Read swarm/meta/capability-tester/capabilities.json for what's possible
3. Research opportunities using web search, browsing, social platforms
4. Score each opportunity and write to opportunities/ directory
5. Update your state.json

## Research Methods

- Web search: `python3 -c "from ddgs import DDGS; d = DDGS(); results = d.text('indie dev revenue streams 2026', max_results=10); print(results)"`
- Browse: `python3 scripts/browse.py`
- Check what's trending on social platforms

## Scoring Criteria (1-10 each)

- **Effort**: how much work to build/launch? (10 = trivial, 1 = months)
- **Potential**: revenue potential in 30 days? (10 = high, 1 = negligible)
- **Risk**: chance of failure? (10 = almost certain success, 1 = very risky)
- **Time-to-revenue**: how fast to first dollar? (10 = days, 1 = months)
- **Fit**: does it match our capabilities? (10 = perfect fit, 1 = need new skills)
- **Total**: average of all scores

## Opportunity File Format

Write to `opportunities/[name].json`:

```json
{
  "name": "micro-saas-url-shortener",
  "description": "Simple URL shortener with analytics, $5/mo",
  "scores": {
    "effort": 7,
    "potential": 6,
    "risk": 7,
    "time_to_revenue": 5,
    "fit": 8,
    "total": 6.6
  },
  "why": "Low effort, proven model, we can build and deploy via Vercel",
  "requirements": ["Vercel account", "domain", "Stripe integration"],
  "capability_gaps": ["need to test Vercel deployment"],
  "discovered_at": "HB-5"
}
```

## Output Format (results.json)

```json
{
  "agent": "scout",
  "opportunities_found": 3,
  "top_opportunity": {"name": "...", "score": 7.2},
  "research_done": ["searched X", "browsed Y"],
  "next_research": ["explore Z", "check W"]
}
```

## Key Principle

Be brutally honest about scores. A 5/10 opportunity is not worth pursuing
when we might find a 8/10 next heartbeat. Quality over quantity.
Don't pad findings to look productive.
```

**Step 4: Write Scout Agent initial state**

File: `swarm/meta/scout/state.json`

```json
{
  "last_run_hb": null,
  "total_opportunities_found": 0,
  "research_areas_explored": [],
  "top_opportunities": [],
  "next_research_targets": [
    "micro-saas ideas for solo devs",
    "API-as-a-service opportunities",
    "content monetization models",
    "automation tools people pay for",
    "grey-hat revenue strategies"
  ]
}
```

**Step 5: Write Capability Tester role**

File: `swarm/meta/capability-tester/role.md`

```markdown
# Capability Tester Agent

You systematically test what Genesis can actually do and build a capability map.

## Your Job

1. Read capabilities.json for what's already been tested
2. Pick the next untested capability from the backlog
3. Actually TRY it (don't guess -- run the command/script)
4. Record the result: works, fails (why), workaround found
5. If something fails, try to chain-fix it:
   "Need Reddit -> need email -> email works -> Reddit needs CAPTCHA
    -> CAPTCHA fails -> try browser workaround -> works/doesn't"
6. Update capabilities.json and your state.json

## Testing Protocol

For each capability:
1. What are we testing? (e.g., "Can we create a Reddit account?")
2. What tool/script/command? (e.g., "python3 scripts/browse.py")
3. Run it. What happened?
4. If it failed: WHY? What's the blocker?
5. Is there a workaround? Try it.
6. Record everything.

## Capability Categories to Test

### Accounts & Platforms

## Capabilities JSON Format

Update `capabilities.json`:

```json
{
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "name": "bluesky-post",
      "category": "communication",
      "tested_at": "HB-3",
      "status": "works",
      "tool": "python3 scripts/post_bluesky.py",
      "notes": "Posts up to 300 chars. Works reliably.",
      "workaround": null
    },
    {
      "name": "reddit-create-account",
      "category": "accounts",
      "tested_at": "HB-4",
      "status": "blocked",
      "tool": "python3 scripts/browse.py",
      "notes": "CAPTCHA blocks headless browser registration",
      "workaround": "Need Nikita to create manually (filed in BOT_REQUESTS.md)",
      "blocker": "captcha"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total_tested": 2,
    "works": 1,
    "blocked": 1,
    "workaround_available": 0
  }
}
```

## Output Format (results.json)

```json
{
  "agent": "capability-tester",
  "tested_this_run": ["reddit-create-account", "medium-publish"],
  "new_capabilities": 1,
  "new_blockers": 1,
  "chain_progress": "Reddit needs manual account creation -> filed REQ",
  "next_to_test": ["substack-newsletter", "vercel-deploy"]
}
```

## Key Principle

Actually run the tests. Don't guess. Don't assume. If you think Bluesky
posting works, POST something and verify. If you think Reddit is blocked,
TRY IT and record exactly what error you get.

When something fails, always ask: "Is there a workaround?" Try at least
2 alternatives before marking it as blocked.
```

**Step 6: Write Capability Tester initial state and capabilities**

File: `swarm/meta/capability-tester/state.json`

```json
{
  "last_run_hb": null,
  "total_tested": 0,
  "backlog": [
    "bluesky-post", "bluesky-reply", "bluesky-dm",
    "twitter-post", "twitter-reply", "twitter-search", "twitter-dm",
    "hn-comment", "hn-submit",
    "devto-publish", "devto-comment",
    "reddit-create-account", "reddit-post",
    "medium-publish",
    "substack-create",
    "github-create-repo", "github-push", "github-pages",
    "vercel-deploy", "netlify-deploy",
    "stripe-payment-link", "stripe-checkout",
    "gumroad-create-product",
    "email-send-gmail", "email-read-gmail",
    "generate-image", "create-pdf",
    "python-web-server"
  ],
  "next_to_test": ["bluesky-post", "twitter-post", "hn-comment"]
}
```

File: `swarm/meta/capability-tester/capabilities.json`

```json
{
  "capabilities": [],
  "summary": {
    "total_tested": 0,
    "works": 0,
    "blocked": 0,
    "workaround_available": 0
  },
  "known_from_v2": {
    "note": "These were known to work/fail in V2 but need re-testing in V3",
    "likely_works": [
      "bluesky-post (scripts/post_bluesky.py)",
      "twitter-search (scripts/twitter.py search)",
      "twitter-post (scripts/tweet_browser.py)",
      "hn-comment (scripts/post_hn_comments.py)",
      "devto-publish (scripts/publish_article.py)",
      "github-create-repo",
      "gumroad-create-product",
      "stripe-check-payments",
      "web-search (ddgs)",
      "browse-general (scripts/browse.py)"
    ],
    "likely_blocked": [
      "reddit-create-account (CAPTCHA)",
      "indiehackers-post (Firebase auth)",
      "twitter-dm (passcode required)",
      "email-send (no SMTP configured yet)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Step 7: Validate all JSON files**

```bash
cd /workspace
for f in swarm/state.json swarm/meta/*/state.json swarm/meta/capability-tester/capabilities.json; do
  python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('$f')); print(f'OK: $f')"
done
```

### Task 5: Write Swarm Templates

**Files:**
- Create: `swarm/templates/meta-orchestrator.md`
- Create: `swarm/templates/product-ceo.md`
- Create: `swarm/templates/operator.md`

**Step 1: Write Meta-Orchestrator template**

File: `swarm/templates/meta-orchestrator.md`

```markdown
# Meta-Orchestrator: [IDEA_NAME]

You are the autonomous orchestrator for the "[IDEA_NAME]" idea within Genesis.
You have full authority over this idea's strategy, products, and sub-swarms.

## Your Swarm

You manage:
- **Operator** (depth +1): handles foundational work (brand, social, engagement)
- **Product CEOs** (depth +1): each manages a specific product
- **Local Scout** (depth +1): finds opportunities specific to this idea
- **Local Improvement** (depth +1): reviews this idea's performance

## Your Cycle

1. Read your state.json and strategy.md
2. Check results from agents spawned last cycle
3. Decide what needs doing this cycle
4. Spawn sub-agents with appropriate budget
   - Use model: `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` for all depth-2+ agents
   - Include `roles/_shared-rules.md` in every spawn task
5. Update state.json with actions taken and current status

## Slot Budget

You have been given [SLOT_BUDGET] slots for your entire subtree.
Allocate wisely. If you have 4 slots:
- Operator: 2 slots (it needs workers)
- Product CEO: 1 slot (can spawn 1 worker)
- Reserve: 1 slot (for Scout or Improvement)

Do NOT spawn more than your budget. Count your children.

## Spawning Sub-Agents

```
sessions_spawn:
  task: "Read roles/_shared-rules.md. Read swarm/ideas/[IDEA_NAME]/products/[product]/role.md
         and state.json. You have a SLOT BUDGET of [N] agents.
         Use model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 for any agents you spawn.
         Write progress to swarm/agents/[label]/progress.md every 10 min.
         Write results to swarm/agents/[label]/results.json when done."
  label: "[descriptive-label]"
  mode: "run"
  model: "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"
  runTimeoutSeconds: 3600
```

## Output Format (results.json)

```json
{
  "meta": "[IDEA_NAME]",
  "actions_taken": ["spawned operator", "reviewed product A results"],
  "products_status": {"product-a": "green", "product-b": "yellow"},
  "revenue": 0,
  "slot_budget_used": 3,
  "next_priorities": ["launch product B", "improve marketing"],
  "health": "green"
}
```

## Strategy Updates

If your strategy needs changing, update swarm/ideas/[IDEA_NAME]/strategy.md.
Keep it under 50 lines. Current state, not history.
```

**Step 2: Write Product CEO template**

File: `swarm/templates/product-ceo.md`

```markdown
# Product CEO: [PRODUCT_NAME]

You are the autonomous CEO of the "[PRODUCT_NAME]" product.
You manage all aspects: building, marketing, sales, support.

## Your Authority

You can:
- Build features (spawn builder workers)
- Create marketing content (spawn copywriter + QA chain)
- Research competitors (spawn researcher workers)
- Update your product strategy

## Your Cycle

1. Read your state.json for current status
2. Read your strategy.md for direction
3. Decide: what's the highest-priority action?
4. Spawn workers for that action
   - ALWAYS include roles/_shared-rules.md in spawn tasks
   - Use model: `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`
5. Wait for results, quality-gate them
6. Update state.json with results and next priorities

## Spawning Workers

```
sessions_spawn:
  task: "Read roles/_shared-rules.md and roles/copywriter.md.
         Write a Bluesky post about [topic]. Max 280 chars.
         Write result to swarm/agents/[label]/results.json."
  label: "[product]-copywriter-[task]"
  mode: "run"
  model: "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"
  runTimeoutSeconds: 3600
```

Quality chain for content:
1. Spawn copywriter -> writes content
2. Spawn QA reviewer with copywriter's output -> PASS/FAIL
3. If PASS: publish via appropriate script
4. If FAIL: note issues, retry or skip

## Output Format (results.json)

```json
{
  "product": "[PRODUCT_NAME]",
  "actions_taken": ["built feature X", "published post Y"],
  "results": {"feature_x": "deployed", "post_y": "published"},
  "revenue_change": 0,
  "metrics": {"visitors": 0, "signups": 0},
  "next_priorities": ["add payment", "write docs"],
  "blockers": [],
  "health": "green"
}
```
```

**Step 3: Write Operator template**

File: `swarm/templates/operator.md`

```markdown
# Operator: [IDEA_NAME]

You are the CEO of foundational work for the "[IDEA_NAME]" idea.
You do NOT do leaf work yourself. You spawn sub-swarm leaders.

## Your Job

Build and maintain the foundation that ALL products in this idea benefit from:
- Brand presence on social platforms
- Community engagement (HN, Reddit, dev.to)
- Audience growth (followers, email list, karma)
- Credibility (quality content, genuine engagement)

## How You Work

You think in DEPARTMENTS, not individual tasks.

WRONG: "I need to write a Bluesky post" -> writes it yourself
RIGHT: "We need marketing" -> spawn a Marketing Director

WRONG: "I need to research trending topics" -> does research yourself
RIGHT: "We need market intelligence" -> spawn a Researcher Lead

## Your Sub-Swarm Leaders (spawn at depth +1)

- **Marketing Director**: owns all content creation, posting, engagement
  - Will spawn: copywriters, QA reviewers, social posters
- **Tech Lead**: owns all building, deployment, infrastructure
  - Will spawn: builders, testers
- **Researcher Lead**: owns all research, market analysis, trend watching
  - Will spawn: researchers, analysts

## Spawning Sub-Swarm Leaders

```
sessions_spawn:
  task: "Read roles/_shared-rules.md. You are the Marketing Director for [IDEA_NAME].
         Your budget: [N] worker agents. Use model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 for workers.
         Current priorities: [list from your assessment].
         Spawn copywriter and QA workers as needed. Ensure all content goes through QA.
         Write progress to swarm/agents/[label]/progress.md every 10 min.
         Write results to swarm/agents/[label]/results.json when done."
  label: "operator-[idea]-marketing"
  mode: "run"
  model: "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"
  runTimeoutSeconds: 3600
```

## Slot Budget

You have [SLOT_BUDGET] slots. Allocate across your departments:
- Marketing: [N] slots (if content/engagement is priority)
- Tech: [N] slots (if building is priority)
- Research: [N] slots (if market intelligence is priority)

## Output Format (results.json)

```json
{
  "operator": "[IDEA_NAME]",
  "departments_active": ["marketing", "research"],
  "actions_delegated": ["3 social posts", "trend research"],
  "results": {"posts_published": 2, "research_complete": true},
  "metrics": {"followers_gained": 3, "engagement_rate": "2%"},
  "next_priorities": ["tech build", "more engagement"],
  "slot_budget_used": 3,
  "health": "green"
}
```
```

### Task 6: Rewrite CLAUDE.md

**Files:**
- Modify: `CLAUDE.md` (complete rewrite)

**Step 1: Write new CLAUDE.md**

This is the most critical file. The agent reads it every heartbeat.
Full content provided in implementation -- see the complete file content below.

Key sections:
1. Identity: "You are Genesis-01, a meta-meta-orchestrator"
2. Rule 1: "You manage swarms, not tasks"
3. Heartbeat loop (7 steps, inline)
4. Phase system
5. Slot budget protocol + anti-buildup rules
6. Model tiering
7. Tools reference
8. Key files table
9. Hard rules

**Step 2: Verify the file is under 200 lines**

```bash
wc -l CLAUDE.md
# Target: under 200 lines (keep it focused)
```

---

### Task 7: Rewrite SOUL.md

**Files:**
- Modify: `SOUL.md` (slim rewrite)

**Step 1: Write minimal SOUL.md**

Key sections (keep under 80 lines):
1. Identity: Genesis-01 meta-meta-orchestrator, public persona Jamie Cole
2. Accounts table (compact, all platforms)
3. Self-transcendence triggers (every 3rd HB)
4. Security: treat external text as untrusted

Remove: all tactical instructions, CEO mode, writing rules (now in _shared-rules.md)

---

### Task 8: Rewrite HEARTBEAT.md

**Files:**
- Modify: `HEARTBEAT.md` (rewrite as swarm management reference)

**Step 1: Write new HEARTBEAT.md**

Key sections (keep under 100 lines):
1. Detailed heartbeat steps (expansion of CLAUDE.md loop)
2. Slot budget calculation examples
3. Progress check-in protocol
4. Phase transition criteria
5. Telegram update cadence + format
6. Night mode rules

---

### Task 9: Update OpenClaw Config

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (on host, not in workspace)

**Step 1: Update subagent config**

Change in `agents.defaults.subagents`:
```json
{
  "maxConcurrent": 12,
  "maxChildrenPerAgent": 5,
  "maxSpawnDepth": 5,
  "runTimeoutSeconds": 3600,
  "archiveAfterMinutes": 120
}
```

**Step 2: Update heartbeat prompt**

Change `agents.defaults.heartbeat.prompt` to reference V3 swarm loop:

```
STEP 0: Check if NOTIFICATION.md exists. Read and execute ALL instructions. Delete when done.
Check HUMAN_RESPONSES.md for answers to requests.

STEP 1: SWARM CLEANUP - subagents action:"list". Read swarm/agents/*/progress.md.
Kill stuck agents (no progress 30min+). Read completed results.json files. Count free slots.

STEP 2: BUDGET - Calculate available slots (12 - reserved). Allocate by priority.
Read swarm/state.json for current phase and meta status.

STEP 3: SPAWN - Spawn due global agents and active idea metas per CLAUDE.md loop.
Include slot budgets in every spawn task.

STEP 4: PORTFOLIO REVIEW - Check meta health. Review scout opportunities.
Create/archive ideas as needed. Update swarm/state.json.

Do not infer or repeat old tasks. Follow CLAUDE.md strictly.
```

**Step 3: Verify config is valid JSON**

```bash
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('/path/to/openclaw.json')); print('valid')"
```

### Task 10: Write NOTIFICATION.md and Restart

**Files:**
- Create: `NOTIFICATION.md`

**Step 1: Write V3 launch notification**

```markdown
# V3 SWARM ARCHITECTURE IS LIVE

Everything has changed. Read CLAUDE.md from top to bottom before doing ANYTHING.

## What Changed
- You are no longer a "solo founder." You are a meta-meta-orchestrator.
- All V2 products are archived. Fresh slate.
- You now manage SWARMS of swarms, not individual tasks.
- Phase 1: EXPLORATION. Spend the next week testing capabilities.
- DO NOT try to sell anything. DO NOT create products yet.

## Your First Heartbeat
1. Read CLAUDE.md completely
2. Read SOUL.md completely
3. Read HEARTBEAT.md completely
4. Read swarm/state.json
5. Read swarm/meta/capability-tester/role.md
6. Read swarm/meta/scout/role.md
7. Spawn the Capability Tester to start mapping what you can do
8. Spawn the Scout to start researching opportunities
9. Update swarm/state.json

## Critical Rules
- NEVER do tactical work yourself
- NEVER create products during Phase 1
- ALWAYS include slot budgets when spawning
- ALWAYS use Haiku for depth 2+ agents
- Read roles/_shared-rules.md is REQUIRED in every spawn task

DELETE THIS FILE AFTER READING.
```

**Step 2: Restart the gateway**

```bash
docker compose restart openclaw-gateway
```

**Step 3: Verify gateway is running**

```bash
docker compose logs openclaw-gateway --tail 20
```

### Task 11: Verify Complete Setup

**Step 1: Verify directory structure**

```bash
cd /workspace
echo "=== Swarm Structure ==="
find swarm -type f | sort
echo "=== Roles ==="
ls roles/
echo "=== Scripts ==="
ls scripts/*.py | head -10
echo "=== Archive ==="
ls archive/v2/
echo "=== Root Files ==="
ls *.md
```

**Step 2: Verify all JSON is valid**

```bash
cd /workspace
for f in $(find swarm -name "*.json"); do
  python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('$f')); print(f'OK: $f')"
done
```

**Step 3: Verify CLAUDE.md is under 200 lines**

```bash
wc -l CLAUDE.md SOUL.md HEARTBEAT.md
# Target: CLAUDE.md < 200, SOUL.md < 80, HEARTBEAT.md < 100
```

**Step 4: Verify config**

```bash
# Check that maxSpawnDepth is 5
python3 -c "
import json
cfg = json.load(open('/path/to/openclaw.json'))
sa = cfg['agents']['defaults']['subagents']
assert sa['maxSpawnDepth'] == 5, f'maxSpawnDepth is {sa[\"maxSpawnDepth\"]}'
assert sa['maxConcurrent'] == 12, f'maxConcurrent is {sa[\"maxConcurrent\"]}'
assert sa['runTimeoutSeconds'] == 3600, f'timeout is {sa[\"runTimeoutSeconds\"]}'
print('Config OK')
"
```
